Dracula is a dark theme for developers with implementations across over 160
apps. I designed and created the Obsidian branch for use with the knowledge
management base [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

The theme is built in pure CSS using CSS variables which follows both the
Dracula Team and Obsidian specifications.
