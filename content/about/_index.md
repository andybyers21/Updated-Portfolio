## Hi, I'm Andy Byers

I'm a web developer from the UK with an interest in data and knowledge
management and UI Design from a technical perspective. Currently freelancing in
web app development. In the past I've worked in leadership positions within the
oil and gas offshore maintenance sector and successfully run a wholly owned
retail operation where I refined my development skills.

I like to iterate quickly, a sticker for writing succinct, understable code.
Designing, testing, and developing software using systems thinking and
problem-solving techniques that I have learned outside of the industry. I am not
married to one technology and choose the right tool for the job. I like to have
a product mindset in everything I design and understand creating value, not
features. I'm a proponent of open source software and open source thinking.

Iâ€™ve background in business management and project management as well as
designing and building apps for risk management, document management and
e-commerce.

I am currently looking for a small and focused team where I can continue to
learn and develop my technical skill.
