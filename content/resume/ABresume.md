## Full Stack Web Developer

---

I’m a web developer who likes to code in Python and Golang. I like to iterate
quickly, a sticker for writing succinct, understandable code. I aim to have a
product mindset and understand creating value, not features. APM qualified with
a background in project management and startups. I am not married to any coding
language or technology, choosing the right tools for the job. A proponent of
open source software and open sourced thinking.
